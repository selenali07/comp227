♡ - a horizontal row under the header containing three images, centered on the screen
♡ - a "card" content area, containing a header, some text, and a button (which can lead to any page or website you wish; 
    it doesn't need to make sense); the width of this area should be 90% or 100% of the screen width
♡ - a footer that is 90% or 100% of the screen width
- all links and buttons should be live and lead to somewhere, but it doesn't matter where--websites, additional HTML 
    pages, whatever
- links and buttons should have some kind of response when hovered over; in the case of the button, the whole button 
    area should be clickable, not just the text

♡ - a footer that is 90% or 100% of the screen width.
- links and buttons should remain clickable; doesn't matter where they lead
- links and buttons should have some kind of response when hovered over; in the case of the button, the whole button area should 
    be clickable, not just the text
