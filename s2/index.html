                               Samuel Langhorne Clemens (that's right, Mark Twain was a pseudonym) was a novelist, journalist, humourist and lecturer born in Florida, Missouri, USA on November 30, 1835 (and died April 21, 1910, Redding, Connecticut).
                                He became famous for his travel narratives such as The Innocents Abroad (1869) and for his novels
                                 The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and follow-up, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). 
                                In Hartford, Connecticut, the Mark Twain House awaits your visit to learn more about the author.
